 - Connecting a network printer involves configuring your PC to communicate with the printer via an IP address on the same network. I will explain how to do this in different situations:

---

### **Configure a Network Printer on Windows 10**
1. **Obtain the printer's IP address**:
   - Check the printer's interface or manual to find the IP address.
   - If unsure, you can use the `arp -a` command in the Command Prompt to list devices connected to the network.

2. **Add the printer on Windows**:
   - Go to **Settings > Devices > Printers & Scanners**.
   - Click on **Add a printer or scanner**.
   - If the printer is not automatically detected, select **The printer I want isnâ€™t listed**.
   - Choose **Add a printer using a TCP/IP address or hostname**.
   - Enter the printer's IP address and configure the driver model if necessary.

### **Example Python Script to Test Connection to a Network Printer**
The script below checks if the printer's IP address is accessible on the network:

```python
import socket

def test_connection(ip, port=9100):
    try:
        # Attempt to connect to the default port (9100)
        with socket.create_connection((ip, port), timeout=5):
            print(f"Connection to the printer at {ip}:{port} was successful!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error connecting to the printer: {e}")

# Replace with your printer's IP address
printer_ip = "192.168.1.100"
test_connection(printer_ip)
```

### **Send Simple Data to a Network Printer**
If the printer supports direct commands, you can send text or RAW commands:

```python
def send_data_to_printer(ip, data, port=9100):
    try:
        with socket.create_connection((ip, port), timeout=5) as sock:
            sock.sendall(data.encode('utf-8'))
            print("Data sent successfully!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error sending data: {e}")

# Example usage
printer_ip = "192.168.1.100"
data = "Test print via Python\n"
send_data_to_printer(printer_ip, data)
```

---

### **Explanation of Ports**
- Network printers typically use **port 9100** for receiving data via the RAW protocol.
- Other protocols, such as LPR, may use different ports (e.g., **515**).

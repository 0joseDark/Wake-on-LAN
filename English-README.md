# Wake-on-LAN

Wake-on-LAN Commands

To perform tasks such as turning on a computer remotely (Wake-on-LAN) or sending documents to a network printer, specific network and operating system functionalities are required. These "magic packets" can be created in Python with the help of specialized libraries. Letâ€™s see how to implement these two features in Python on Windows 10:

### 1. Turning on a Computer Remotely (Wake-on-LAN)

**Wake-on-LAN** (WoL) allows turning on a computer remotely over the network by sending a "magic packet" to the MAC address of the device you want to turn on.

#### Installing the required library:
First, you need to install the `wakeonlan` library, which enables sending the WoL packet.

```bash
pip install wakeonlan
```

#### Example of code to send the "magic packet":
```python
from wakeonlan import send_magic_packet

def turn_on_computer(mac_address):
    try:
        send_magic_packet(mac_address)
        print(f"Magic packet sent to {mac_address}.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error sending magic packet: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Replace with the MAC address of the computer you want to turn on
    mac_address = "00:11:22:33:44:55"
    turn_on_computer(mac_address)
```

### Explanation:
- **MAC Address:** The MAC address is the unique identifier of the network hardware. Replace the value `00:11:22:33:44:55` with the MAC address of the computer you want to turn on.
- **send_magic_packet:** This function sends the WoL packet to the computer, allowing it to turn on.

### 2. Printing to a Network Printer
[Printing with Wake-on-LAN](https://github.com/0joseDark/Wake-on-LAN/blob/main/English-impressoras.md)

To print documents to a network printer, you can use the `win32print` library, which is part of the `pywin32` package. This package allows controlling printers in Windows, including network printers.

#### Installing the required library:
First, you need to install the `pywin32` package:

```bash
pip install pywin32
```

#### Example code to print:
```python
import win32print
import win32api

def print_document(file_path):
    try:
        # Get the default printer
        printer = win32print.GetDefaultPrinter()
        print(f"Default printer: {printer}")

        # Send the document to the printer
        win32api.ShellExecute(0, "print", file_path, None, ".", 0)
        print(f"The file {file_path} was sent to the printer {printer}.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error sending the document to the printer: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Replace with the path to the file you want to print
    file_path = "C:\\path\\to\\document.pdf"
    print_document(file_path)
```

### Explanation:
- **GetDefaultPrinter:** Retrieves the system's default printer.
- **ShellExecute with "print":** Executes the print command for the specified file, sending it to the default or specified printer.

### Considerations:
- For **Wake-on-LAN**, the BIOS and network settings of the remote computer must be configured to support WoL.
- For **network printing**, ensure the network printer is properly configured and accessible.

These examples should help you create "magic packets" to turn on computers and print remotely in Python on Windows 10.
